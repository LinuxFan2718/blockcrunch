# Brief email on your career goals in crypto + background

I am motivated by decentralization of power from governments, corporations, and wealthy individuals to ordinary people. Cryptocurrencies have great promise to achieve this, and I want to be part of the movement.

I would like to raise awareness of the societal value of cryptocurrencies that exist now. Too many people believe that 100% of crypto is scams. But crypto has already created enormous value far beyond seignorage. Examples include acting as a store of value for people stuck using inflationary currency such as the Argentinian peso, low-cost money transfers across international borders, and prediction markets.

Correctly organized prediction markets are an underutilized tool today, one that benefits all of us by providing valuable information to the public. Some of the most exciting prediction markets today rely on cryptocurrencies to function. It would benefit humanity in general if more people used these markets. One of the main barriers to large-scale prediction market usage are laws in the US. US citizens, broadly speaking, are prohibited by the government from using prediction markets. However, there is a trend in the US towards liberalizing gambling laws.
